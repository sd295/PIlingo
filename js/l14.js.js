            <p>Welcome to your Sweden-themed interactive project! In this project, you'll create multiple greeting cards with different Swedish words.</p>
            <p>Follow the steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Create three greeting cards with the words: "Hej", "Tack", and "VÃ¤lkommen".</li>
                <li>Each card should have a background color and some padding.</li>
                <li>Add a button to each card that, when clicked, flips the card to show an English translation.</li>
                <li>Use CSS transitions to animate the flip effect.</li>
                <li>Optionally, add a Swedish flag emoji ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª somewhere on each card.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Click "Run Code" to see your interactive greeting cards!</p>
