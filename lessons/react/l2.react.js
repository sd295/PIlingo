        instructions: `
1. Import the 'useState' hook from React.
2. Create a component called 'DishVoter'.
3. Inside 'DishVoter', create two state variables using 'useState', one for 'borschtVotes' and one for 'varenykyVotes'. Initialize both to 0.
4. Display the current vote count for Borscht and Varenyky (a type of dumpling). [2]
5. Add a button for each dish.
6. When a button is clicked, use the appropriate setter function to increase the vote count for that dish by 1.
